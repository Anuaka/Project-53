       Usain Bolt, in full Usain St. Leo Bolt, <br>
       (born August 21, 1986, Montego Bay, Jamaica), <br>
       Jamaican sprinter who won gold medals in the 100-metre and 200-metre races in<br>
        an unprecedented three straight Olympic Games<br>
        and is widely considered the greatest sprinter of all time.
      <!--add the paragraph-->

       At age 16 Bolt cut the junior (age 19 and under) 200-metre world record to 20.13 sec,<br>
        and at 17 he ran the event in 19.93 sec, becoming the first teenager to break 20 seconds in the race. <br>
        However, hampered by a hamstring injury, he failed to advance beyond the 200-metre heats at the 2004<br>
         Olympics in Athens, Greece, and placed last in the 2005 world track-and-field championships final.

        At 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 metres), Bolt defied the conventional wisdom that very <br>
        tall sprinters are disadvantaged as fast starters. In 2007 he appeared newly dedicated <br>
        to his training and earned a silver medal in the 200 metres at the world championships. <br>
        He also persuaded his coach to let him try the 100 metres, and he ran 10.03 sec in his first professional<br>
         race at the distance. On May 3, 2008, he lowered his best time to 9.76 sec, then the worldâ€™s second fastest mark.<br>
          Four weeks later in New York City, Bolt broke the world record, running 9.72 sec to defeat world champion Tyson Gay.
